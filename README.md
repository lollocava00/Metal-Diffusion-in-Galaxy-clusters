# Metal-Diffusion-in-Galaxy-clusters
Simulation of metal diffusion in the ICM for the Perseus Cluster based on the paper 'Impact of stochastic gas motions on galaxy cluster abundance profiles' by Rebusco et., al 2005. The aim of the project is to show the possible parameters for efficient metal distribution under reasonable diffusion timescales.(reproduce observed abundance profile).
